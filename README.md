The Laplace equation solved and its corresponding boundary conditions are from the 5-4 Application section (page 167) of "Computational Fluid Dynamics (Vol. 1)" 4th Edition by Klaus A. Hoffmann (Author), Steve T. Chiang. 

The equation is discretized on a staggered mesh, and different Krylov Space methods have been used to solve the resultant equation; their convergent rate is compared. 

The resultant matrix from the discretization of the equation is presented in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format (see 3.4 Storage Schemes: "Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems" 2nd Edition by Yousef Saad) for the efficiency in the computation of matrix-vector multiplication.
